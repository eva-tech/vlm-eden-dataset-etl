# Note: dcm4che is a Java-based DICOM toolkit and cannot be installed via pip.
# The dcm2jpg conversion tool requires Java and the dcm4che library.
# If a Python-based alternative (e.g., pydicom + PIL) is preferred, it should be
# implemented in the transform module. For now, dcm4che must be installed separately
# or provided via the Docker image.
